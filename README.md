## Overview

This repository offers a comprehensive guide to basic machine learning concepts and the implementation of various machine learning models. It is designed to help beginners understand the core principles of machine learning and to provide hands-on experience through practical code examples.

## Machine Learning Concepts

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: When a model is too complex, it may capture noise in the data rather than the underlying trend.
- **Underfitting**: Occurs when a model is too simple to capture the complexity of the data.

### Regularization
- A technique to prevent overfitting by penalizing more complex models. This is typically done using L1 or L2 norms.

### Model Selection Process
1. **Dataset Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Training**: Fit different models on the training set.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess the models on the validation set.
4. **Selection**: Choose the best performing model based on validation results.
5. **Testing**: Apply the selected model to the test dataset.
6. **Performance Comparison**: Analyze how the model's performance on the test set compares to its performance on the validation set.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Regression**: RÂ² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Classification**: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).

### Parameter Estimation Techniques
- **Gradient Descent**: \(\theta_{t+1} = \theta_{t} - \lambda \nabla J(\theta_t)\)
- **Variations**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Adam (adaptive moment estimation).
